  Callback Function in Javascript
  Promises in Javascript
  CRUD Operation using JSON Server
  
  1. Callback Function
      It is a function which is passed as a parameter
         to an already existing function.
      
     
  2. Promises in Java 
      Promises in Javascript are used to execute a function based
       on the result.
      It has got 2 states
         1. resolve ---> when the function is executed successfully
         2. reject  ---> when the function has an exception or not fully
                          executed then it will reject
                          
         let promise = new Promise(resolve, reject)
         
   3. JSON SERVER
   
        run the server and establishes connection to the server
        server is nothing but db.json file
        db.json file contains database information
        
        1. Install the json-server
            npm install -g json-server
            
        2. json-server db.json // to run the json-server
              it will create an url
              
        url is used to perform CRUD operations using javascript
        
       HTTP Methods for CRUD
       
         POST ----------> Used to create a Data or Insert Data to server
         GET  ----------> used to get the Data from the server
         PUT  ----------> used to update the Data 
         DELETE --------> used to delete a record
       
        We will write the code to perform CRUD operations using javascript
